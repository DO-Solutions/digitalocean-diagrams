# digitalocean-diagrams

This repository hosts a collection of architectural diagrams that I have created in my role as a Solutions Engineer at DigitalOcean. These diagrams have served — and continue to serve — multiple purposes:
- To visually explain the workings of DigitalOcean services to the customers I assist.
- To provide a resource for my peers, who may find these diagrams useful in their own work.
- To facilitate my learning of DigitalOcean's services when I joined the company.

I believe that visual representation simplifies learning and helps reinforce understanding. Therefore, I am sharing these diagrams publicly for anyone seeking to understand how DigitalOcean services function.

The architectural diagram presented on this page offers a high-level overview of DigitalOcean's services. For more detailed diagrams of specific services, please visit the subsequent pages.

If you wish to learn more about DigitalOcean's services, feel free to contact me at [vprokopov@digitalocean.com](mailto:vprokopov@digitalocean.com). Should I no longer be employed at DigitalOcean, you are welcome to reach out to the sales team at [sales@digitalocean.com](mailto:sales@digitalocean.com). A global team of talented engineers will be happy to provide assistance.

**Disclaimer:** These diagrams have not been reviewed by the DigitalOcean product teams for accuracy and may contain errors. They represent my understanding of the services based on research and experience. For official documentation, please refer to [docs.digitalocean.com](https://docs.digitalocean.com).
